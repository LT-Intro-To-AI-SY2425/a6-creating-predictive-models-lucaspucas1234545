# Part 2 - Training and Testing Data Writeup

After completing `a6_part2.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What makes this model more effective than the model you created in the previous lesson?

One of the reasons that this model is more effective is because we are splitting up the data set into testing and training data randomly. 

2. What does the R squared coefficient tell you about the model?

The R squared value tells me that this model is slightly less correlated than the model from pt 1. The value of r^2 was 6.06 vs 6.25. 

3. Would you say that your model is accurate? What evidence supports your conclusion? Consider the meaning of the predicted and actual values in the context of the chart below from the American Heart Associationâ€™s website on understanding blood pressure.

I would say that the model is moderately accurate. The low amount of data points, and the variation between the points means that the model is probably as good as it will get. The predicted value for the 43 year old fits into the High Blood Pressure Stage 1 section, but if that was me, I would probably go to the doctors to get it checked just in case.
