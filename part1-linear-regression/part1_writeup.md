# Part 1 - Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part1.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the r squared value?  What does this say about this linear regression model?

The r squared value represents how correlated the data is, squared. The closer this value is to 1, the more correlated the data is, and the closer it is to 0, the less correlated it is. It basically says whether the linear regression of the data is possible.

2. According to your model, what is the predicted systolic blood pressure for a person who is 42 years old?



3. How accurate do you think this model's predictions are?  Do you think this model is accurate enough to reliably predict someone's blood pressure based on their age?  Why or why not?  And if not, what could improve the model?
