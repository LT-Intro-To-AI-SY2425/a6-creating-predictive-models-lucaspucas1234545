# Part 5 - Unsupervised Learning Writeup

After completing `a6_part5.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. Develop a name for each customer group based on the information from the graph. For example, one group might be called “Frugal” while another might be called “Shopaholic.” Explain your reasoning for each label.

    High income high spending: Spending money because they can
    High income low spending: Acting broke to stay rich
    Middle income middle spending: regular people
    Low income high spending: Credit card debt
    Low income Low spending: Spending within their means

2. What group would a customer who has a medium income and low spending habits be in?

    It would probably be closer to the high income low spending people.

3. Choose one cluster of interest to you. How might the marketing team approach this specific customer group?

    I think the people spending because they can is a group to target because they can afford to shop and already are used to doing it. Just gotta sell them on the product, and you might get some new loyal high rolling customers walking through the doors daily.
